The mouse gesture sample application shows how to use [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Models_Markov_HiddenMarkovClassifier.htm classifiers] based on discrete hidden Markov models to perform gesture recognition. The gestures recognized by the sample application are performed with the mouse.

The sample application also shows how to [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/P_Accord_Statistics_Models_Markov_Learning_BaseHiddenMarkovClassifierLearning_2_Rejection.htm reject invalid gestures] using [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/P_Accord_Statistics_Models_Markov_BaseHiddenMarkovClassifier_1_Threshold.htm Threshold models].
