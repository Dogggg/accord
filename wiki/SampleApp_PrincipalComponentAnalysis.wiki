This sample application shows how to compute and use [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Analysis_PrincipalComponentAnalysis.htm Principal Component Analysis (PCA)] to perform dimensionality redution. The application (and the thus framework)
support both correlation and covariance variants of the analysis, and is able to compute projections and reversions from the PCA space. By default, the application comes with the sample data given by Lindsay's on her excellent _Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis_.
