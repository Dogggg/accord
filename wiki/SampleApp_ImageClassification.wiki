The Image Classification sample application shows how to perform image classification using the [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Imaging_BagOfVisualWords.htm Bag of Visual Words (BoW) model] with [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Imaging_SpeededUpRobustFeaturesDetector.htm SURF] and [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_KMeans.htm K-Means].

The BoW model is used to transform the many SURF feature points in a image in a single, fixed-length feature vector. The feature vector is then used to train a [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/N_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines.htm Support Vector Machine (SVM)] using a [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/N_Accord_Statistics_Kernels.htm variety of kernels].
