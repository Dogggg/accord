This sample application shows how to compute and use [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Analysis_LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.htm Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] to perform classification-oriented dimensionality reduction. The application can perform the classification of new samples using a linear classifier, perform the projection and revert input points from the linear discriminant space.
