#summary Donations and development requests

As requested, here is the donation button for the framework. The Accord.NET Framework is absolutely free and will always be free of charge. However, more than once people have asked for a way to drive development resources into the project, and here is a way for it.

If you are interested in the implementation of a particular feature, feel free to specify it in the donation box - features which are requested the most will receive priority in the next updates. And keep in mind you can donate _any value you would like_!
