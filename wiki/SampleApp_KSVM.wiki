This sample application shows how to use Kernel Support Vector Machines (k-SVMs) to solve a classification problem. The sample application comes with default sample data with can be loaded in the File->Open menu.

After a sample data has been loaded, one can configure the settings and create a learning machine in the second tab. The picture below shows the decision surface for the Ying-Yang classification data generated by an [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/M_Accord_Statistics_Kernels_Gaussian_Estimate.htm heuristically] initialized [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_Statistics_Kernels_Gaussian.htm Gaussian-kernel] SVM after it has been trained using [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimization.htm Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO)]. The framework offers an [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/N_Accord_Statistics_Kernels.htm extensive list of kernel functions to choose from].

The sample application used to support regression. However, [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_VectorMachines_Learning_SequentialMinimalOptimizationRegression.htm regression has since moved to a GPL-only module] and is not linked with the rest of the framework anymore. Installing GPL modules [http://code.google.com/p/accord/wiki/GettingStarted?tm=6 is optional during framework installation].
