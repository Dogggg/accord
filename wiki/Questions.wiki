== How fast is SVM learning? =

Users often find the SVM learning algorithm to take too much time. This, however, may be a reflection of the particular choice of learning parameters. For instance, attempting to create a hard-margin SVM (with very high C) using a linear kernel in a non-linearly separable dataset will diverge and possibly lead to an infinite loop. 

In those cases, consider using the automatic parameter estimation routines in SequentialMinimalOptimization and in the choosen Kernel function. Values returned by those routines may lead to more sparse machines and faster training times.
