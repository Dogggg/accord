#summary Accord.NET Framework GitHub repositories

Due the high number of user contributions submitted lately, and the increased facilities at sharing and contributing code offered by Git, the framework is now being replicated to GitHub at the following address:

  https://github.com/accord-net/framework

The updated project page will also be gradually relocated to:

  http://accord-net.github.io/

Hopefully this change can ease and provide new ways for user contributions to flow into the project. If you have any comments or questions about this update, please let me know!

Newer releases will also be made available through GitHub's [https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases release system], which should also overcome the recently announced [http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.br/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html discontinuation of the Google Code's download service for new project releases]. So, once everyone is ready, let's meet again at GitHub!
