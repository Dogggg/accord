In January 2014, Google started disabling the ability for project owners to create new software releases through Google Code, without offering any suitable alternative for this system.

The Accord.NET Framework has thus started a gradual migration to GitHub, offering the same [https://github.com/accord-net/framework/releases installer executables, binaries and source packages] previously offered here. You don't have to clone the repository or anything like that in order to keep using the project: everything is as simple as it has always been.

However, if you like the community-sharing spirit of Git-based repositories, feel free to also fork the project and work directly with the project's sources.
