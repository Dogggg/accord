This page enlists several works which have used Accord.NET in some point of their development. The framework also has been used in a number of academic studies, and the number keeps rising. If you have any interesting application of the framework, feel free to post about it on the [http://groups.google.com/group/accord-net project forums].

 * [http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/fe1a5891-61de-4553-8741-fcce23a56291 Point and Call] - Windows phone application to read a phone number using the phone's camera. After reading the number, it is possible to either call or save this number in your contact list, useful for reading numbers from magazines or business cards.

 * [http://harperia.ru/en/home.html Harperia] - Language agnostic speech recognition. Uses AForge.NET and Accord.NET to process audio signals and recognize specific recordings using Neural Networks.

 * GMM-EM - Estimates parameters of a multidimensional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by expectation-Maximization (EM) methods and performs Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis based on given true labels of input vectors in medical research. Created in a time where GMMs were not yet available in Accord.NET, this project uses a combination of many libraries to achieve its goals. <br />

= Preferred citation style =

If you use Accord.NET Framework in your research, you are invited to cite the project in your publication. There are many advantages in clearly stating all tools used in a research, including the increased reproducibility and transparency which should be the goal of any serious academic publication. If you would like to accept this invitation and cite Accord.NET or any material published together the framework in your work, the preferred style of citation is:

 * C. R. Souza, "The Accord.NET Framework," Apr 2012; http://accord.googlecode.com
