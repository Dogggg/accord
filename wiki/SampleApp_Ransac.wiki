This sample application shows how to use the [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/T_Accord_MachineLearning_RANSAC_1.htm Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)] algorithm to fit [http://accord.googlecode.com/svn/docs/html/N_Accord_Statistics_Models_Regression_Linear.htm linear regression models]. The algorithm works with any model or function, producing a robust version of the model which is less sensitive to outliers.
